# One Dark Global Theme
This is a dark global theme based on the breeze theme and "One Dark" colour palette! After applying the theme, please change the size of the window decorations to "Tiny" otherwise it will look weird. 4 Wallpapers are also included so you can apply them by going to your desktop > Right Click > Configure Desktop and Wallpaper > Apply the wallpaper. If you don't like the default window decorations, you can change them to Breeze.
